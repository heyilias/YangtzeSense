## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **Backend & Simulation:** Custom logic in TypeScript simulating WSN node behavior
- **Visualization:** Charts, Map, Dashboard, and Alert System
- **Machine Learning:** Simple anomaly detection and water quality classification (Good, Fair, Poor)

## 📊 Features

- Simulated sensor nodes (Temperature, pH, Turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen, Conductivity)
- Real-time visualization of water quality
- Energy-aware node simulation with battery usage
- Routing algorithm comparison (LEACH vs PEGASIS)
- Alerts for anomalies and low-quality conditions
- Node management interface (add/remove sensors)

## 🧠 ML Integration

A basic rule-based or ML model is used to classify water quality into:
- Good
- Fair
- Poor  
Also detects anomalies if sudden abnormal values appear in any sensor reading.

## 📡 Wireless Sensor Network Layers

Each layer of the WSN OSI model is simulated:
- **Physical:** Simulated sensors and energy usage
- **Data Link:** Node-to-node communication
- **Network:** Routing via LEACH and PEGASIS
- **Transport:** Simulated data reliability
- **Application:** Dashboard interface and visualization

## 📦 Future Improvements

- Connect with real-time sensor data from IoT hardware
- Use advanced ML models for better predictions
- Deploy scalable backend (Node.js + database)
- Improve mobile responsiveness
